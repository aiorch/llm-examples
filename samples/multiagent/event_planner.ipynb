You’ll made us feel home and there was not even a single situation where we had to call you. Everything was done on time, all services were professionally managed, and you both always stood by us. Deciding on MLR was the best thing we did, and we are extremely happy and satisfied with MLR. Our guests have returned with excellent memories of the event. Thank you so much Again.”\n",

Even though it has been a month since the wedding, I really didn’t want to miss the opportunity to say THANK YOU for everything you did in those two days. I have never come across someone who is so polite, accommodating and approachable. I remember calling you so many times to clarify every small doubt and I loved how you patiently answered all my questions. Even on the previous night of the wedding, I called you at 11pm because of some emergency and you still attended my call and helped me with my emergency!!! My entire family was very impressed with the way you and your staff were so helpful and caring. Right from getting the rooms ready earlier than expected, to making sure my guests are comfortable, you took care of everything. We still talk about how my wedding went smoothly because of you : ) You really are a savior for people trying to host a successful event. So once again, a big THANK YOU for your wonderful hospitality. Will never forget it in my life.”\n",

Even though it has been a month since the wedding, I really didn’t want to miss the opportunity to say THANK YOU for everything you did in those two days. I have never come across someone who is so polite, accommodating and approachable. I remember calling you so many times to clarify every small doubt and I loved how you patiently answered all my questions. Even on the previous night of the wedding, I called you at 11pm because of some emergency and you still attended my call and helped me with my emergency!!! My entire family was very impressed with the way you and your staff were so helpful and caring. Right from getting the rooms ready earlier than expected, to making sure my guests are comfortable, you took care of everything. We still talk about how my wedding went smoothly because of you : ) You really are a savior for people trying to host a successful event. So once again, a big THANK YOU for your wonderful hospitality. Will never forget it in my life.”\n",
